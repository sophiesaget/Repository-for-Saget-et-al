The Python code is run using the relevant lines for each scenario and hiding the other scenarios. Outputs of the code are then pasted into the excel sheet in the relevant scenario tab to determine the change in amount of each crop.

- "linear-optimisation-clca-all_scenarios.ipynb" is the Python code that performs the linear optimisation.
- "production-per-rotation-v9" is the excel used in for running the Python code "linear-optimisation-clca-all_scenarios.ipynb" 
- "linear optimization diet change rotations paper for Repo v35" shows the resuling crop balances for each scenario
